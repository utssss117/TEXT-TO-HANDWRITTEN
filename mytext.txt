It’s taken just four years for Blackpink to become one of the biggest girl bands in the world, with members Jennie, Jisoo, Rosé and Lisa continuing to smash new records and forge new ground. 
They were the first K-pop girl group to play at Coachella and to reach 1 billion YouTube views — now they’re the most-subscribed-to music group on the platform — as well as being the first girl group from any country to feature on Forbes Asia’s 30 Under 30 list.

In 2019, they broke three Guinness World Records with the single “Kill This Love”, which has had more than 312 million plays on Spotify and over 824 million YouTube views — a mere fraction of the quartet’s billions of streams, downloads, views and followers. 
That same year they also undertook the most financially successful concert tour by a Korean female group. They’ve been front-row fixtures at runway shows and the faces of mega brands including Chanel, Puma, Louis Vuitton and Dior.
 And all this with just a handful of songs in their repertoire. How on earth did they do it?

 There were big shoes to fill; the beloved, trailblazing four-member girl group 2NE1 were over and Blackpink were expected to revive the bold EDM pop sound they’d embodied.
  Their debut, Square One, was an overnight smash, the insistent build of “Whistle” and cocky chorus on “Boombayah” making for a short but thrilling introduction.
